# P90 – Dark Theme for Visual Studio Code
This Visual Studio Code color theme was inspired by the popular 1990s primary (and green!) color scheme. That is also the origin of it's name – P90 (*Palette* 90).

In formatting color placements, I attempted to follow semantic highlighting practices for common programming languages/file types.

### Installation
1. Within Visual Studio Code, navigate to the **Extensions** tab and type "P90".
> Alternatively, you can visit the theme directly in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kelcisayshello.p90).
2. Click **Install**. If necessary, also click **Set Color Theme**.
3. Whenever you want to change back to the P90 color theme at a later time, you can always navigate to <kbd>Code</kbd> > <kbd>Settings</kbd> > <kbd>Theme</kbd> > <kbd>Color Theme</kbd> and select **P90** from the list of *installed* color themes.
